# Chat-application-using-python-and-socket-programming
The goal of this assignment is to (i) introduce you to socket programming and (ii) to implement a reliable transport protocol. In this assignment, you will implement a chat application (like messenger) that will allow users to transfer messages and files. The assignment must be done individually, and you should use Python. The assignment has the following two parts: Part 1: A simple chat application using UDP, which is a transport protocol that does not ensure reliable communication. Part 2: Extending the chat application in Part 1 to ensure reliable communication of messages and files, by implementing a reliable protocol on top of UDP.
